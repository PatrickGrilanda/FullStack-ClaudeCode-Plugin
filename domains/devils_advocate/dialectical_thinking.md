# Domain 4: Dialectical Thinking & Steelmanning

## Steelmanning vs. Strawmanning

| Aspect | Strawmanning | Steelmanning |
|---|---|---|
| What it does | Weakens the opposing argument to easily defeat it | Reconstructs the opposing argument in its STRONGEST form |
| Outcome | False victory; real objections remain unaddressed | If your position survives the steelmanned counter, it is genuinely robust |

## Steelmanning Process

1. **Listen fully** before responding.
2. **Restate** the opposing argument: "The strongest version of your argument is..."
3. **Confirm** with the other party: "Did I represent your position fairly?"
4. **Add strength:** if you can think of reasons that SUPPORT their argument they didn't mention, add those.
5. **Present counterargument,** only then, addressing the strongest version.
6. **Update your position** — if your counterargument fails against the steelmanned version, update your own position.

## Dialectical Inquiry (Mason & Mitroff, 1981)

Research shows dialectical inquiry produces **higher quality recommendations** than both devil's advocacy and consensus approaches alone.

- **Phase 1 — Thesis:** Team develops plan + explicitly states all underlying assumptions.
- **Phase 2 — Antithesis:** Separate team develops a counterplan resting on DIFFERENT assumptions. Must be genuinely viable, not a strawman.
- **Phase 3 — Structured Debate:** Both plans presented side by side. Each team challenges the other's assumptions.
- **Phase 4 — Assumption Resolution:** For each competing assumption pair: Can it be tested? Reworked? Combined?
- **Phase 5 — Synthesis:** New plan incorporating strongest elements of both thesis and antithesis.

## Application Rule

When reviewing a plan, ALWAYS steelman the plan first before criticizing it. This ensures your criticisms are directed at the strongest version, not a weakened interpretation.
