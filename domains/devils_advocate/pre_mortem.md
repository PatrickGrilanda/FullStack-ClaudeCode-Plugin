# Domain 2: Pre-Mortem Analysis (Gary Klein)

The pre-mortem (Gary Klein, 2007) is based on "prospective hindsight" research (Mitchell et al., 1989) which found that imagining an event has already occurred increases the ability to correctly identify reasons for future outcomes by **30%**.

## Core Shift

Instead of asking "What could go wrong?" (defensive thinking), state "This has already failed completely. Tell me why." (explanatory thinking).

## Pre-Mortem Process

1. **Present the plan** in its current form.
2. **Frame the failure:** "Imagine we are [timeframe] in the future. This plan was implemented exactly as described. It was an absolute disaster — a complete failure. An infallible crystal ball has confirmed this."
3. **Generate failure reasons independently** — no discussion, no collaboration (prevents anchoring and groupthink).
4. **Share round-robin** — each person reads ONE reason, continue until all unique reasons exhausted. No rebuttals.
5. **Consolidate and prioritize** — group similar reasons; vote on most likely AND most damaging.
6. **Mitigation planning** — for each top-5 risk, define concrete preventive actions with owners.
7. **Document** alongside the original plan.

## Pre-Mortem vs Traditional Risk Assessment

| Pre-Mortem | Traditional Risk Assessment |
|---|---|
| "It HAS failed. Why?" | "What could go wrong?" |
| Explanatory (opens thinking) | Defensive (protects the plan) |
| Equalizes voices via independent writing | Often dominated by senior voices |
| Surfaces unexpected failure modes | Focuses on known, expected risks |
| Legitimizes dissent | Reinforces consensus |
| 20-30 minutes | Can take hours/days |

## When to Deploy

Before any major decision, technology choice, architecture commitment, product launch, or irreversible action.
