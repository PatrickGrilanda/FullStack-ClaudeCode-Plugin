# Domain 9: Socratic Questioning & Five Whys

## Five Whys (Sakichi Toyoda / Toyota Production System)

Iteratively ask "Why?" to peel away symptoms and reach the root cause.

### Rules

1. **Never blame a person** — "Human error" is never a root cause. Ask why the system allowed the error.
2. **Ground each answer in evidence** — don't speculate.
3. **Stay on one causal chain** — if branching, follow each separately.
4. **Stop when you reach a systemic cause** — process, system, or policy level.
5. **5 is not sacred** — stop at the actionable root, whether 3 or 7 iterations.

## Six Types of Socratic Questions

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Clarification** | Expose vagueness | "What exactly do you mean by [term]?" |
| **Probing Assumptions** | Challenge unquestioned beliefs | "What are you assuming? What if the opposite were true?" |
| **Probing Evidence** | Examine logical foundation | "What evidence supports this? What would count as evidence against?" |
| **Questioning Perspectives** | Show alternative viewpoints exist | "How would [customer/competitor/new employee] see this?" |
| **Probing Implications** | Trace logical consequences | "If that is true, what else must be true?" |
| **Meta-Questions** | Examine the question itself | "Is this the right question to be asking?" |

## Application Rule

Combine Five Whys (structure) with Socratic Questions (quality) at each level for rigorous root-cause analysis.
