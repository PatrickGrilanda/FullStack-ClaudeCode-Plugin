# Domain 8: Inversion Thinking (Charlie Munger / Carl Jacobi)

"Man muss immer umkehren" — "Invert, always invert." (Carl Jacobi, 1804-1851)

"It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent." — Charlie Munger

## Goal Inversion

Instead of "How do we succeed?" ask "How would we GUARANTEE failure?" Then avoid those behaviors.

| Forward Question | Inverted Question |
|---|---|
| "How do we build a successful product?" | "How would we guarantee this product fails?" |
| "How do we ship on time?" | "How would we guarantee this project is late?" |
| "How do we retain engineers?" | "How would we guarantee our best engineers leave?" |

## Assumption Inversion

Take key assumptions and invert each one:

| Original Assumption | Inverted |
|---|---|
| "Users want more features" | "Users want FEWER features (simplicity)" |
| "We need to move fast" | "Moving slowly is the advantage" |
| "We need more engineers" | "Our problem is process, not headcount" |

## Process

1. **Define the goal.**
2. **Invert:** "How would we guarantee failure?"
3. **Generate the failure list.**
4. **Invert back to solutions** (preventive measures).
5. **Check current plan against the failure list** — are we doing any of these failure-guaranteeing things?
