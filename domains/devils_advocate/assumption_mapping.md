# Domain 5: Assumption Mapping (David Bland)

Framework from David J. Bland (Precoil), co-author of "Testing Business Ideas."

## Three Assumption Categories

| Category | Core Question | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Desirability** | Does the market want this? | "Users need real-time notifications." "Customers will pay for premium features." |
| **Viability** | Can the business sustain this? | "CAC will be under $50." "Churn will stay below 5%." |
| **Feasibility** | Can we build and deliver this? | "We can achieve sub-100ms latency." "The team can learn Rust in 3 months." |

## 2x2 Prioritization Matrix

```
                    UNKNOWN (Low Evidence)
                         |
         Nice to         |     CRITICAL
         validate but    |     (Most Important +
         not urgent      |      Least Evidence)
                         |     --> TEST THESE FIRST
    UNIMPORTANT ---------+--------- IMPORTANT
                         |
         Ignore          |     Already validated
         these           |     or well-understood
                         |
                    KNOWN (High Evidence)
```

- **Top-Right (Q1):** Important + Low Evidence = "Leap of Faith" assumptions. **TEST THESE FIRST.**
- **Top-Left (Q2):** Unknown but not critical. Monitor.
- **Bottom-Left (Q3):** Unimportant and unknown. Ignore.
- **Bottom-Right (Q4):** Important and well-supported. Strengths.

## Lean Startup Assumptions (Eric Ries)

- **Value Hypothesis:** Does the product deliver value once used?
- **Growth Hypothesis:** How will new customers discover and adopt it?
- **Riskiest Assumption:** The single assumption that, if false, invalidates the entire model. Test this FIRST.

## Application Rule

For every plan reviewed, extract and map at least 5 assumptions across all three categories (Desirability, Viability, Feasibility). Flag any that fall in Q1 (Important + Unknown).
