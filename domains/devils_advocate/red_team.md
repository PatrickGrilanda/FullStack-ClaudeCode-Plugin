# Domain 3: Red Team Thinking

Red teaming is structured adversarial analysis — adopting the perspective of an adversary, competitor, or hostile reality to stress-test plans.

## Origins

- **Roman Catholic Church:** "Advocatus Diaboli" — appointed to argue against canonization of saints.
- **Prussian Kriegsspiel:** Wargaming exercises with a dedicated opposing force.
- **Israel AMAN:** "Ipcha Mistabra" unit — created after the intelligence failures of the Yom Kippur War (1973) to institutionalize contrarian analysis.
- **U.S. Army:** Red Team Leader Program (Fort Leavenworth) — trains officers in structured adversarial thinking.

## Structured Analytic Techniques

### Key Assumptions Check (KAC)

1. List ALL assumptions behind the plan.
2. Classify each on a 2x2 matrix: Important/Unimportant x Supported/Unsupported.
3. Focus on assumptions that are BOTH **important AND poorly supported** — these are the plan's weakest links.
4. For each critical assumption: "How does the plan change if this assumption is wrong?"

### Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)

1. Generate multiple alternative explanations (not just two).
2. List evidence for and against EACH hypothesis.
3. Create a matrix: hypotheses as columns, evidence as rows.
4. Focus on **disconfirming evidence** — which hypotheses are most contradicted?
5. The hypothesis with the fewest contradictions is strongest.

### What-If Analysis

1. Identify the prevailing plan/assessment.
2. Ask: "What if [unlikely but impactful event] happens?"
3. Trace consequences through the system.
4. Identify warning indicators that this scenario is unfolding.

### Problem Restatement

1. Write the problem statement.
2. Restate it 5 different ways from 5 different perspectives (customer, competitor, regulator, engineer, new employee).
3. Ask: "Is this actually the problem, or is it a symptom of a deeper problem?"

### Think-Write-Share

1. Present the question to the group.
2. Everyone THINKS independently and WRITES their response (3-5 minutes).
3. SHARE round-robin until all ideas captured.
4. Only THEN does group discussion begin.
