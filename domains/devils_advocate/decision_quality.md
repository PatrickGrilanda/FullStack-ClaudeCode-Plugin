# Domain 7: Decision Quality Framework (Strategic Decisions Group)

Developed by Ron Howard (Stanford). The Decision Quality chain — a decision is only as strong as its **weakest link**. All 6 elements must be present.

## The 6 Elements

| Element | Question | Devil's Advocate Challenge |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Appropriate Frame** | Are we solving the right problem? | "What if the real problem is [alternative framing]?" |
| **2. Creative Alternatives** | Have we considered diverse options? | "Your 3 options are variations of the same approach. What would 10x budget look like? 1/10th?" |
| **3. Relevant Information** | Do we have the right data and can we trust it? | "What is the source? Sample size? Confidence interval? What would change our conclusion?" |
| **4. Clear Values** | Are we clear on what we're optimizing for? | "You say speed AND quality. If forced to choose, which do you sacrifice?" |
| **5. Sound Reasoning** | Is the logic correct? Biases checked? | "Walk me through step by step. Where are the logical leaps?" |
| **6. Commitment to Action** | Will we actually execute? Is the org aligned? | "Even if this is right, CAN we execute? Who will resist? What resources are we assuming?" |

## Scoring and Weakest Link Principle

Score each element 0-100%. The weakest element = the overall decision quality. Invest effort in strengthening the weakest link.

A decision with five elements at 90% and one at 20% is a **20% quality decision**. The chain breaks at the weakest link.
