| **Economic** | Macroeconomic conditions | GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, unemployment |
| **Social** | Societal and cultural trends | Demographics, lifestyle, health consciousness, education, cultural attitudes |
| **Technological** | Innovation landscape | AI/ML, automation, R&D spending, digital infrastructure, patent activity |

| **Environmental** | Ecological factors | Climate change, carbon regulations, sustainability, energy consumption |

### Scoring

For each factor:
1. Classify as **Opportunity** or **Threat**
2. Rate **Likelihood** (1-5)
3. Rate **Impact** (1-5)
4. **Score = L x I**
5. Prioritize high scores
6. Develop strategic responses

**PESTLE outputs feed directly into SWOT** (external factors = Opportunities and Threats).
