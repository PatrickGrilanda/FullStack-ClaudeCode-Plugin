## Business Model Canvas (Osterwalder & Pigneur)

9-block framework for mapping a business model holistically.

| Block | Definition | Key Question |
|---|---|---|
| **Customer Segments** | Who are we creating value for? | Mass market, niche, segmented, multi-sided, diversified? |
| **Value Propositions** | What value do we deliver? What problem do we solve? | Newness, performance, customization, design, brand, price, cost reduction, risk reduction, accessibility, convenience? |
| **Channels** | How do we reach our customer segments? | Direct (web, sales), indirect (partner stores), owned vs. partner? Phases: awareness → evaluation → purchase → delivery → after-sales |
| **Customer Relationships** | What type of relationship does each segment expect? | Personal assistance, self-service, automated, communities, co-creation? |
| **Revenue Streams** | How does each segment generate revenue? | Asset sale, subscription, licensing, advertising, brokerage, usage fee, lending/leasing? |
| **Key Resources** | What assets are essential? | Physical, intellectual (IP, patents), human, financial? |
| **Key Activities** | What must we do to deliver? | Production, problem-solving, platform/network management? |
| **Key Partnerships** | Who are our key partners and suppliers? | Strategic alliances, coopetition, joint ventures, buyer-supplier? |
| **Cost Structure** | What are the most important costs? | Cost-driven vs. value-driven? Fixed costs, variable costs, economies of scale/scope? |
