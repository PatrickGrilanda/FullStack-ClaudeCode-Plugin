## Porter's Five Forces

Developed by Michael Porter (Harvard, 1979). Assesses industry-level competitive intensity and attractiveness.

| Force | Key Questions | High Threat Indicators |
|---|---|---|
| **Threat of New Entrants** | What are the barriers to entry? Capital requirements? Brand loyalty? Regulation? | Low capital requirements, weak brand loyalty, no patents, deregulation |
| **Bargaining Power of Suppliers** | How many suppliers exist? Switching costs? Uniqueness of inputs? | Few suppliers, high switching costs, unique inputs, forward integration threat |
| **Bargaining Power of Buyers** | How many buyers? Price sensitivity? Switching costs? Information availability? | Few large buyers, low switching costs, standardized products, high price sensitivity |
| **Threat of Substitutes** | Are there alternative products/services? Performance-to-price ratio? | Many substitutes, low switching costs, substitute improving in price/performance |
| **Industry Rivalry** | How many competitors? Differentiation level? Exit barriers? Growth rate? | Many competitors of similar size, low differentiation, high fixed costs, slow growth |

**Scoring:** Rate each force 1-5 (1=weak, 5=strong). Total score interpretation:
- 5-10: Highly attractive industry (low competitive pressure)
- 11-17: Moderately attractive
- 18-25: Unattractive industry (intense competition)

**6th Force (Complementors):** Brandenburger & Nalebuff (1996) added complementors -- products/services that increase value of yours (e.g., app developers for a platform).
