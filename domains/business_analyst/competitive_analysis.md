## Competitive Analysis

### Competitor Profiling

For each competitor, capture:
- Company overview
- Products/services
- Market position (share, segments, brand)
- Strengths & weaknesses
- Strategy
- Financials
- Customer base
- Distribution
- Marketing
- Technology

**Competitor Tiers:**
- **Tier 1 (Direct):** Similar products, same market
- **Tier 2 (Moderate overlap):** Overlapping products or adjacent markets
- **Tier 3 (Indirect/future entrants):** Potential future entrants

### Competitive Positioning Map

Plot competitors on two strategically important dimensions (e.g., Price vs. Quality). Identify clusters (crowded positioning) and gaps (opportunities).

### Blue Ocean Strategy (Kim & Mauborgne, 2005)

Create uncontested market space instead of competing in red oceans.

**ERRC Grid (Four Actions Framework):**

| Action | Question |
|---|---|
| **Eliminate** | Which factors the industry takes for granted should be eliminated? |
| **Reduce** | Which factors should be reduced well below industry standard? |
| **Raise** | Which factors should be raised well above industry standard? |
| **Create** | Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered? |

**Value Innovation:** Pursue differentiation AND low cost simultaneously by eliminating/reducing (lowering costs) while raising/creating (increasing value).
