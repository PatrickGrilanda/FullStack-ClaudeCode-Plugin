## TAM / SAM / SOM (Market Sizing)

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| **TAM** (Total Addressable Market) | Total revenue opportunity if you achieved 100% market share |
| **SAM** (Serviceable Addressable Market) | Portion of TAM your product can realistically serve (geographic, product, distribution constraints) |
| **SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable Market) | Portion of SAM you can realistically capture given competition and resources |

### Calculation Approaches

**Top-Down (fast, less accurate):**
```
TAM = Total industry revenue (from Gartner, IDC, Statista)
SAM = TAM x % served by your product category/geography/segment
SOM = SAM x estimated achievable market share %
```

**Bottom-Up (preferred for accuracy):**
```
TAM = Number of potential customers x Average Revenue per Customer (ARC)
SAM = Number of reachable customers x ARC
SOM = Number of realistically acquirable customers x ARC
```

### Common Mistakes to Flag

- **The 1% Fallacy:** "If we capture just 1% of a $100B market..." -- arbitrary and meaningless. Build SOM bottom-up with specific acquisition plans.
- **Double-counting segments:** Ensure segments are MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)
- **Static market sizing:** Account for CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)
- **Unsupported assumptions:** Every percentage MUST have a cited source or explicit logic
