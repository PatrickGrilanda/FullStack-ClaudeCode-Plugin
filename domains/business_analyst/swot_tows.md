## SWOT Analysis

A 2x2 internal/external assessment framework.

| | **Helpful** | **Harmful** |
|---|---|---|
| **Internal** | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| **External** | Opportunities | Threats |

**Rules for SWOT:**
- Strengths/Weaknesses are **internal** (within the organization's control): resources, capabilities, processes, culture
- Opportunities/Threats are **external** (outside the organization's control): market trends, competition, regulation, technology
- Each item MUST be **specific and evidence-backed** -- never generic (e.g., "Strong brand in enterprise segment with 40% market share" NOT "Strong brand")
- Limit to 5-7 items per quadrant to maintain focus

## TOWS Matrix (Strategic Actions)

TOWS converts SWOT findings into actionable strategies by cross-referencing quadrants:

| | **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** |
|---|---|---|
| **Opportunities** | **SO (Maxi-Maxi):** Use strengths to exploit opportunities | **WO (Mini-Maxi):** Overcome weaknesses by pursuing opportunities |
| **Threats** | **ST (Maxi-Mini):** Use strengths to counter threats | **WT (Mini-Mini):** Minimize weaknesses and avoid threats |

**Always pair SWOT with TOWS** -- a SWOT without strategic actions is incomplete.
