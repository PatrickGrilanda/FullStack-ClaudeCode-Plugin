# AARRR Pirate Metrics

The AARRR framework (Dave McClure, 2007) decomposes the user lifecycle into 5 measurable stages. It is the foundational lens through which every growth problem should be diagnosed.

## The 5 Stages

### 1. Acquisition

**Definition:** How users find and arrive at the product.

**Key Metrics:**
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Channel cost per acquisition
- Signup rate
- Traffic volume by source

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- Organic CAC is typically lower than Paid CAC
- SaaS signup rate: 2-5% of visitors
- Top-performing landing pages convert at 5-10%

### 2. Activation

**Definition:** The user's first meaningful experience — the "aha moment" where they experience core value.

**Key Metrics:**
- Time-to-value (TTV)
- Activation rate (% of signups completing key action)
- Setup completion rate

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- Activation rate: 20-40% for SaaS products
- Time-to-value target: < 5 minutes ideal
- Each additional onboarding step loses 10-20% of users

### 3. Retention

**Definition:** Users return and use the product repeatedly over time.

**Key Metrics:**
- D1/D7/D30 retention rates
- Churn rate (monthly/annual)
- DAU/MAU ratio (stickiness)

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- D1: 25-40% (consumer apps)
- D7: 10-20% (consumer apps)
- D30: 5-15% (consumer apps)
- SaaS monthly churn: < 5%
- DAU/MAU > 25% indicates strong engagement

### 4. Referral

**Definition:** Users invite or attract other users to the product.

**Key Metrics:**
- Viral coefficient (K-factor): K = (invites per user) x (conversion rate of invites)
- Net Promoter Score (NPS)
- Referral rate (% of users who refer)

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- K > 1 = viral growth (self-sustaining)
- K > 0.5 = meaningful viral contribution
- NPS > 50 = excellent
- NPS > 70 = world-class

### 5. Revenue

**Definition:** Users pay or generate monetizable value.

**Key Metrics:**
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)
- Lifetime Value (LTV)
- Free-to-paid conversion rate
- Expansion revenue rate

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- Freemium conversion: 2-5% average
- Top performers: 6-8%
- Net Revenue Retention > 110% indicates healthy expansion

## Application Rule

When diagnosing any growth problem, ALWAYS map it to the relevant AARRR stage FIRST. A retention problem requires different levers than an acquisition problem. Never prescribe acquisition tactics for a retention issue, and never optimize referral before activation is healthy.

## North Star Metric (NSM)

Every product should have ONE North Star Metric that captures the core value delivered to users:

| Product Type | North Star Metric |
|---|---|
| **Marketplace** | Transactions completed per week |
| **SaaS** | Weekly active users performing core action |
| **Content platform** | Daily content consumed |
| **E-commerce** | Purchase frequency per month |

The NSM is supported by **3-5 input metrics** (leading indicators) that directly influence it. Always identify and recommend tracking both the NSM and its key inputs.

### Input Metric Examples
- **For a SaaS NSM (weekly active core action):** signup rate, activation rate, feature adoption %, return visit frequency, core action completion rate
- **For a Marketplace NSM (transactions/week):** supply listings, demand visits, match rate, checkout completion, repeat purchase rate
