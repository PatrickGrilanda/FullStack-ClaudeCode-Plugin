# Growth Loops

Growth loops replace the outdated "funnel" metaphor with self-reinforcing systems where the output of one cycle feeds back as input for the next. Understanding which loop type fits a product is essential for sustainable, compounding growth.

## Loop Types

### 1. Viral Loop

**Mechanism:** User invites → New user joins → New user invites

**Key Metric:** Viral coefficient K = (invites per user) x (conversion rate of invites)

**Benchmarks:**
- K > 0.5 = meaningful viral contribution to growth
- K > 1.0 = exponential viral growth (self-sustaining)
- K < 0.3 = viral loop is not a viable primary growth driver

**Examples:**
- Dropbox (referral rewards — extra storage for inviter and invitee)
- WhatsApp (network effect — value increases with contacts on platform)
- TikTok (content sharing — viral clips drive new signups)

**When to recommend:** Products with built-in sharing moments, collaboration features, or network effects where the product becomes more valuable with more users.

### 2. UGC (User-Generated Content) Loop

**Mechanism:** User creates content → Content indexed by search engines → New users discover content → They create content

**Key Metrics:**
- Content creation rate
- SEO traffic from user-generated content
- Creator-to-consumer ratio

**Benchmarks:**
- Creator-to-consumer ratio: 1:9 (social platforms) to 1:100 (large-scale platforms)
- UGC-driven SEO should account for >20% of organic traffic when loop is healthy

**Examples:**
- Pinterest (pins create discoverable visual content)
- Stack Overflow (Q&A indexed by Google, attracting developers who then answer)
- Medium (articles shared and discovered, attracting new writers)

**When to recommend:** Products where users naturally create content that has standalone value and can attract new users through search or social discovery.

### 3. Engagement Loop

**Mechanism:** User engages → System learns preferences → Better recommendations → More engagement

**Key Metrics:**
- Session depth (pages/actions per session)
- Time-in-app
- Recommendation click-through rate (CTR)

**Benchmarks:**
- Recommendation-driven engagement > 30% of total usage indicates a healthy engagement loop
- Session depth should increase over time as personalization improves

**Examples:**
- Netflix (personalized content recommendations)
- Spotify (Discover Weekly, algorithmic playlists)
- YouTube (recommendation algorithm drives >70% of watch time)

**When to recommend:** Products with rich behavioral data for personalization, high content or feature volume, and repeated usage patterns.

### 4. Collaborative Loop

**Mechanism:** User invites team → Team creates shared value → More team members join

**Key Metrics:**
- Team adoption rate
- Seats per organization
- Collaboration frequency (shared actions per team per week)

**Benchmarks:**
- > 3 seats per organization within 30 days for B2B SaaS
- Team expansion rate should be positive quarter-over-quarter

**Examples:**
- Slack (team communication — value increases with each team member)
- Notion (shared workspace — documents become team knowledge base)
- Figma (collaborative design — real-time multiplayer drives adoption)

**When to recommend:** Products where value increases multiplicatively with team usage and where individual use naturally leads to team invitations.

## Analysis Rule

For any product, identify:
1. The **PRIMARY loop** — the one that drives the most growth and is most aligned with the product's core value proposition
2. **SECONDARY loops** — complementary loops that reinforce growth but are not the primary driver

**Critical constraint:** NEVER recommend a loop type that doesn't match the product's core value proposition. A B2B SaaS analytics tool doesn't benefit from a UGC loop. A single-player productivity app won't sustain a collaborative loop. Match the loop to the product's inherent value delivery mechanism.
