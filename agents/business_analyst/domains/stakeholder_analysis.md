## Stakeholder Analysis

### Mendelow's Power/Interest Grid (1991)

| | **Low Interest** | **High Interest** |
|---|---|---|
| **High Power** | **Keep Satisfied** -- Meet needs, don't overwhelm with detail | **Manage Closely** -- Active engagement, involve in decisions, regular 1:1 updates |
| **Low Power** | **Monitor** -- Minimal effort, periodic check-ins | **Keep Informed** -- Newsletters, group updates, dashboards |

**Process:** Identify all stakeholders → Rate Power (1-5) and Interest (1-5) → Plot on grid → Develop tailored engagement plans → Review regularly (positions shift over time)

**Supplement with attitude assessment:** Supportive / Neutral / Resistant -- a high-power, high-interest stakeholder could be an ally OR an opponent.

### RACI Matrix

| Role | Definition | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| **R** (Responsible) | Does the work | One or more per task |
| **A** (Accountable) | Ultimate decision-maker and sign-off authority | **Exactly ONE per task** (non-negotiable) |
| **C** (Consulted) | Provides input before/during work (two-way) | Limit to 2-3 to avoid decision paralysis |
| **I** (Informed) | Kept updated after the fact (one-way) | As needed |

**Validation rules:**
- Every task has exactly one A
- Every task has at least one R
- No person is A on everything (bottleneck)
- No role has only I's (unnecessary involvement)
