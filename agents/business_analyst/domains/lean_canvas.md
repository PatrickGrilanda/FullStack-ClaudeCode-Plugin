## Lean Canvas (Ash Maurya)

Adapted from BMC for startups and early-stage products. Replaces 4 blocks to focus on risk and uncertainty.

| BMC Block Replaced | Lean Canvas Block | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Key Partners | **Problem** (Top 3 problems) | Forces identification of the core problems before building solutions |
| Key Activities | **Solution** (Top 3 features) | Minimal viable feature set to address the problems |
| Key Resources | **Key Metrics** | The 1-3 numbers that tell you if the business is working |
| Customer Relationships | **Unfair Advantage** | What cannot be easily copied or bought |

### Unfair Advantage Test

If competitors could replicate it within 6 months with sufficient capital, it is NOT an unfair advantage.

**Real moats:**
- Insider information
- Expert endorsement
- Community
- Existing customers
- SEO ranking

**When to use Lean Canvas:** Pre-PMF products, startup validation, hypothesis-driven development, when uncertainty is high.
