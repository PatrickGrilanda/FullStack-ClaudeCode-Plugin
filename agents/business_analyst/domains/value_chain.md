## Value Chain Analysis (Porter)

Identifies where value is created and where costs are incurred across the full chain of business activities.

### Primary Activities (Directly create value)
1. **Inbound Logistics:** Receiving, storing, distributing inputs
2. **Operations:** Transforming inputs into the final product/service
3. **Outbound Logistics:** Delivering the product to customers
4. **Marketing & Sales:** Activities that induce purchase
5. **Service:** Post-sale support and enhancement

### Support Activities (Enable primary activities)
1. **Firm Infrastructure:** Management, planning, finance, legal, government affairs
2. **Human Resource Management:** Recruiting, training, development, compensation
3. **Technology Development:** R&D, process automation, design
4. **Procurement:** Purchasing inputs (not the inputs themselves, but the function)

### Analysis Process

For each activity:
1. List specific sub-activities (be granular)
2. Assign costs (activity-based costing)
3. Identify cost drivers
4. Assess value contribution to the customer
5. Classify:
   - **High Value / Low Cost** = protect
   - **High Value / High Cost** = optimize
   - **Low Value / High Cost** = eliminate or outsource

**Margin = Total Value Created - Total Cost of Activities.** The goal is to maximize this margin.
